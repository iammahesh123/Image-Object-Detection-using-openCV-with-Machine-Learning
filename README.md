# Object-Detection using Machine Learning
OpenCV <b>dnn</b> module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow.

When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are

<li>YOLO</li>
<li>SSD</li>
<li>Faster R-CNN</li>
Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<li>opencv</li>
<li>numpy</li>
pip install numpy opencv-python

<h2>YOLO(You Only Look Onces)</h2>

Download the pre-trained YOLO v3 weights file from this <a href="https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights">link</a>.

YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time. ... This means that prediction in the entire image is done in a single algorithm run. The CNN is used to predict various class probabilities and bounding boxes simultaneously. The YOLO algorithm consists of various variants.

<h2>CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)</h2>


A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
